          <p style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}><strong>
            Online sexual exploitation refers to the use of digital technology, such as the internet and social media platforms, to sexually exploit and abuse individuals, often for the purposes of grooming, coercion, or trafficking. It involves the manipulation, coercion, or blackmailing of victims into engaging in sexual activities or producing sexually explicit content. Perpetrators may use various tactics, such as deception, threats, or promises of affection or financial gain, to exploit their victims. Online sexual exploitation can have devastating consequences for victims, including psychological trauma, loss of privacy, and exploitation.</strong></p><br></br>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>1. Grooming</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>- Grooming involves building a relationship with a child or adolescent, often over a period of time, with the intention of sexually exploiting them.</li>
                <li>- Perpetrators may use social media, chat rooms, online gaming platforms, or other online spaces to gain the trust of their victims.</li>
                <li>- Over time, they gradually introduce sexual topics into the conversation and may provide attention, affection, or gifts to manipulate the child into complying with their demands.</li>
                <li>- This process can escalate to requests for sexually explicit images or videos, or even offline meetings for sexual encounters.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><br></br>2. Sextortion</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>- Sextortion is a form of blackmail where perpetrators threaten to distribute sexually explicit material or information unless the victim complies with their demands.</li>
                <li>- This can involve threats to share compromising photos or videos with the victim's friends, family, or online contacts, or threats to publish the material on public platforms.</li>
                <li>- Perpetrators often exploit the fear, shame, and embarrassment of their victims to coerce them into sending more explicit content, money, or other favors.</li>
                <li>- Victims may feel trapped and powerless to resist the demands of the perpetrator.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong><br></br>3. Online Trafficking</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>- Online trafficking involves the recruitment, grooming, and exploitation of individuals for commercial sexual purposes through online channels.</li>
                <li>- Traffickers may use social media, dating apps, or online classifieds to identify and groom potential victims.</li>
                <li>- They may promise false opportunities, such as employment or romantic relationships, to lure individuals into exploitative situations.</li>
                <li>- Once victims are under their control, traffickers may force them into prostitution, pornography production, or other forms of sexual exploitation, often using threats, violence, or coercion to maintain control.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

              <ul>
                <li>- Feature sexually suggestive or explicit content, such as pornography websites, or adult dating platforms.</li>
                <li>- This causes negative effects, especially if they are displayed inappropriately or targeted at vulnerable populations, such as children or individuals with a history of trauma.</li>
                <li>- In some cases, it may contribute to the normalization of sexual objectification, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and attitudes toward sexuality.</li><br></br>
